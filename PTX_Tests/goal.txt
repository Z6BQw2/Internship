Step 1. Find how the registers used by mma_sync are chosen by trying different registers through [asm volatile("mov.f32 ...] in order to put register values in actual printable variables.

First Step failed, onto step 2

Step 2. 2 options are available. The limitation of Step 1 is that PTX forces the use of virtual registers. I can either go down to SASS to check actual registers by name, or stay with PTX and create my own mma_sync to control the register access.
Option 1 seems the most difficult, but also the most amusing, so I'll start exploring it.

My choice is done, I'll use cubin and cuobjdump -sass to get the sass of my matmul, and find how registers are stored by hand.

After looking for information as to how to execute .sass, it's now clear that it's not possible as is. Option 2 therefore seems like the only option.
